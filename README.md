# OpPoDyn Development Repository

[![Build Status](https://github.com/hexaeder/OpPoDyn.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/hexaeder/OpPoDyn.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

This is an experimental repository for exploration of the new PowerDynamics design as part of the OpPoDyn Project.

Once the design converges the code will be moved to the PowerDynamics.jl repository, essentially replacing it. Thus, the `OpPoDyn.jl`-Package won't be registered and is for experimental use only.

During development, this Github Repository will be also used for tracking issues/features of for the new PowerDynamics/NetworkDynamics stack.
