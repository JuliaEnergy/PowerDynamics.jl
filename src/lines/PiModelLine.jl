# Arguments
- `from` : node `k`
- `to` : node `m`
- `y`: admittance of line between `k` and `m`
- `y_shunt_km`: shunt admittance at the end connected to node `k`
- `y_shunt_mk`: shunt admittance at the end connected to node `m`
- `t_km`: transformer ratio at the end connected to node `k`
- `t_mk`: transformer ratio at the end connected to node `m`

# Assumptions:
- the line admittance is symmetric
