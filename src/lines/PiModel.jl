Assumptions:
* the line admittance is symmetric

# Arguments
- `Y`: line admittance
- `Y_shunt_km`: shunt admittance at the end connected to node `k`
- `Y_shunt_mk`: shunt admittance at the end connected to node `m`
- `T_km`: transformer ratio at the end connected to node `k`
- `t_mk`: Transformer ratio at the end connected to node `m`
